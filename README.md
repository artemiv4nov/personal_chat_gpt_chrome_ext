# ChatGPT Chrome Extension

## Overview

This Chrome extension provides a convenient way to communicate with OpenAI's ChatGPT directly from your browser. With this extension, you can:

- Chat with ChatGPT in a user-friendly interface
- Save your chat history for future reference
- Easily delete your chat history when needed
- Add your API key for seamless integration with OpenAI's API

## Differences from chat.openai.com

While chat.openai.com provides a platform for engaging with ChatGPT, there are several advantages to using this Chrome extension instead:

1. **Privacy**: The extension enables each user to have their own private chat history, preventing others from seeing their conversations. In contrast, on chat.openai.com, all users sharing an account can view each other's dialogues.

2. **Organization**: The extension allows users to manage their conversations independently, without being affected by the dialogues of other users sharing the same account on chat.openai.com.

3. **Ease of use**: With the extension, users can access ChatGPT directly from their browser toolbar, making it convenient and easy to use. There's no need to navigate to a specific website or manage multiple tabs.

4. **Customization**: The extension can be easily customized, offering the flexibility to tailor the user interface or functionality to better suit individual needs.

These benefits make the ChatGPT Chrome extension a more suitable choice for users who require a private, organized, and accessible ChatGPT experience.

## Note to OpenAI

This extension has been fully developed with the help of ChatGPT, demonstrating its capabilities and potential for various use cases. We believe that an alternative like this extension could be useful for users who would benefit from a special corporate pricing plan allowing individual accounts to be centrally billed through a company, which is currently only available for platform.openai.com.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to the following projects and resources that have contributed to the development of this Chrome extension:

1. **markdown-it**: This extension uses the [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) library, which is distributed under the MIT License. This library allows us to render Markdown-formatted text within the chat interface.

2. **Coffee Cup Icon**: The icon for this extension is a coffee cup with the number 8, taken from the [iOS 7 Icons by Icons8](https://www.iconarchive.com/show/ios7-icons-by-icons8/Very-Basic-Icons8-Cup-icon.html) collection. We appreciate the availability of this free resource.
